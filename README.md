# MicroSol

This is a (hopefully) faithful reimplementation of SOL.EXE, the best computer game of all time. It's written in plain, vanilla, library-free JavaScript and should work on all modern PC browsers. It currently does _not_ work properly on mobile devices, something that should be fixed in the future.

You can play it at [xndc.github.io/microsol](https://xndc.github.io/microsol/).
